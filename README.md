Rabbit_IO
project for learning to work with docker, docker compose and elastic
my goal is to read data from rabbit-mq, filter only my wanted fields from it 
and sends it to another queue.

Also, i will send the data to elastic search in order to Do stats on.

The logs will be written to docker volume and elastic-db :)
Good luck for me!
